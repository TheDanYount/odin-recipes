    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You have had your meal and your sides and at last come to that capstone of the evening,
        a sweet treat to end your day: dessert. You will want something not as robust as the meal
        itself, yet still bold in its flavor profile. Consider the classic chocolate souffle.</p>
    <p>It does take some skill to achieve a souffle's signature 'rise' and texture, but it is
        still well within the capabilities of even an amateur cook. The trick lies in the proper
        creation and folding of a meringue and a chocolate mixture. The result is well-worth the
        effort, an almost-irrestistable treat for yourself, and a great gift for family and friends.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 Tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 ounce semi-sweet choclate</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li> 4 1/3 Tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 4 Tablespoons butter and chocolate (chopped) in the microwave. Do so
            in 20 second increments, stirring in between, until completely melted and
            combined.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg yolks, vanilla extract, and salt into chcolate mixture. Set
            aside.</li>
        <li>Using a mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on high speed until soft
            peaks form. Add in 3 Tablespoons sugar 1 Tablespoon at a time and mix for
            5 seconds in between. Then continue to mix until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Fold the egg white/meringue mixutre into the chcolate mixture in thirds.
            Refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Place an oven rack at the bottom third of your oven. Preheat to 400 degrees.</li>
        <li>Brush 4 ramekins with the remaining butter (softened) Sprinkle with the rest
            of the sugar. Rotate to thoroughly coat the butter with the sugar and discard
            the excess</li>
        <li>Pour batter into ramekins. Run a spatula around the rims of the ramekins, 
            creating a channel between the batter and the rims of the ramekins. Place
            ramekins on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Reduce oven temp to 375. Bake for 13-14 minutes, until the edges are set,
            and the center barely jiggles when tapping the pan. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
