    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My Grandmother was a wonderful cook. My mother, too. I have not kept up the tradition.
        From my perspective, most things from the groecery store are at most 1 step from being
        eaten. And no, this is not from a health perspective. I do not eat well-chosen
        vegetable medleys, nor have I internalized a commitment to removing processed foods
        from my diet. I am not much of a cook. Modern convenience has given me more free time
        than generations past, but a modern mindset makes even small projects like baking seem
        cumbersome. One dish well-worth pulling myself from langour is the creme brulee.</p>
    <p>The creme brulee did not take a genius to create. It is the answer to what would happen
        if one took the most delectable ingredients and combined them together. While it may
        have calories to reflect this, it most certainly has taste to reflect this and I find 
        myself enthusiastically making creme brulees again and again, even while my dinners
        remain pan-seared or even merely microwaved affairs.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cream (heavy works best)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>5 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar + more for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a saucepan, combine cream, vanilla extract, and
            salt. Cook until hot.</li>
        <li>Beat egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar together until light. Pour 1/4 of the vanilla
            cream mixture into the yolk/sugar mixture. Mix. Pour this into the rest of the
            vanilla cream mixture. Stir. Pour into 4 ramekins. Place ramekins into a baking
            dish, and fill that dish with water halfway up the sides of the ramekins.</li>
        <li>Bake 30-40 minutes, until centers just set. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Top custard with sugar (1 teaspoon for a thin crust, more for a thicker crust).
            Blowtorch. Serve. If topping with berries, serve soon after topping, as juices
            will soften the sugar crust.
        </li>
    </ol>
