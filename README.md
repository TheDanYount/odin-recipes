This was my first real coding project. Herein I am documenting my experience.
I'm delighted to find I remember how to set up an HTML boilerplate.
I remember most git commands, but had to copy/paste the git clone arguments.
I added images and changed a recipe page, but only wrote about the images in
my commit message, a definite mistake.
I am surprised by the amount of typos I've had, even in a relatively simple
project. I guess that's just something to acclimate to: a prescision mindset.
All in all, I am happy with the results. when I test my project by openning up
these files locally, I am proud of what I have created, even if it is rather
brutalist in artistic terms.
